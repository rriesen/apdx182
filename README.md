We use this github repo to collect artifacts for our SC'20 paper
submission pap332.

We report results for four applications in our paper. Data we
produced, instructions on how to obtain the code and additional
information (such as input decks), as well as information how
we compiled and ran each application, are contained in separate
sub-directories.
